🚚 Supply Chain Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing the location of a distribution center (DC) for McTrump’s fast-food outlets in New York to minimize total shipping distances.

📦 Project Highlights:
Tools Used: Microsoft Excel, Excel Solver, SolverTable, Python (for coordinate calculations)

Objective: Minimize total annual shipping distance to 7 store locations

Techniques Applied:

Non-linear optimization

Sensitivity analysis (One-way & Two-way)

Geographic constraints modeling

📍 Key Results:
Identified optimal DC coordinates using Euclidean distance modeling

Achieved 3,364 miles as the minimum total annual shipping distance

Sensitivity analysis revealed the impact of shipment volume on distribution efficiency
